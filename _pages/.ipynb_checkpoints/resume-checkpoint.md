# Míriam Herrero Valea, PhD

I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Institut de Física d’Altes Energies (IFAE), specializing in the application of machine learning, and computational techniques, together with theoretical insights, to physical systems. My recent work focuses on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep learning methods, and data-driven simulations, with application on gravitational physics. I bring a strong background in AI programming (Python, TensorFlow, JAX) and experience working on interdisciplinary, collaborative projects with a focus on high-performance computing and machine learning.


## Experience

### Institut de Física d’Altes Energies - *Juan de la Cierva fellow*
#### 2022 - Present | Barcelona, Spain

- I have managed several projects on machine learning applications, including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks for solving differential equations with singularities.
- I collaborate with a broad international team on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) project, developing data analysis pipelines using high-performance computing techniques.
- I have done research on the use of time-series forecasting models and deep learning for gravitational wave physics, focusing on GPU acceleration.
- I have tutored a MSc student and two Bachelor degree final projects. All of them graduated with excellent marks.

### Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati - *Research Fellow*
#### 2019 - 2022 | Trieste, Italy
- I collaborated on international research projects applying computational techniques in gravitational physics.
- I worked on understanding the imprints of exotic compact objects in astrophysical data.

### École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - *Research Fellow*
#### 2016 - 2019 | Lausanne, Switzerland
- I developed algorithms to perform predictions from physical models, by leveraging computer tensor algebra.
