title: "About me"
---

I am a senior research scientist, specializing in the application of machine learning and computational techniques, together with theoretical insights, to physical systems. 

My recent work focuses on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep learning methods, time series forecasting, and data-driven simulations, which are directly applicable to data science and artificial intelligence frameworks. 

I bring a strong background in ML programming (Python, TensorFlow, JAX) and experience managing and working on cross-functional, collaborative projects with a focus on results.
