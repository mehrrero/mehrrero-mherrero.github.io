title: "About me"
---

I am a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Institut de Física d’Altes Energies (IFAE), specializing in the application of machine learning, and computational techniques, together with theoretical insights, to physical systems. 

My recent work focuses on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep learning methods, and data-driven simulations, with application on gravitational physics. 

I bring a strong background in AI programming (Python, TensorFlow, JAX) and experience working on interdisciplinary, collaborative projects with a focus on high-performance computing and machine learning.
